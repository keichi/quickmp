quickmp
=======

**quickmp** is a high-performance matrix profile library for time series data
analysis. It provides efficient implementations of the STOMP algorithm with
support for both CPU and NEC Vector Engine (VE) backends.

quickmp is optimized for computing matrix profiles of many short-to-medium
length time series. On VE, it achieves high-throughput computation by
leveraging multiple devices and streams.
